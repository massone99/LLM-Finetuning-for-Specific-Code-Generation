Implement an Akka Actor using the FSM trait named TrafficLightActor. The actor should have three states: Red, Green, and Yellow. It should transition between these states in the order: Red → Green → Yellow → Red, with each state lasting for a specified duration (e.g., Red for 3 seconds, Green for 2 seconds, Yellow for 1 second). In each state, the actor should print the current state.
