Design an Akka Supervisor Actor in Scala named EscalatingSupervisor that supervises a child actor named FaultyChildActor. The FaultyChildActor throws a NullPointerException when it receives a "causeNull" message. Implement the supervisor's strategy to escalate the failure to its own supervisor upon encountering an exception. Demonstrate the supervision hierarchy and failure escalation.
