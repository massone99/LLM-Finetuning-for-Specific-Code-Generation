Design an Akka Actor in Scala named CircuitBreakerActor that interacts with an unreliable external service. Use Akkaâ€™s CircuitBreaker to handle failures gracefully. The actor should attempt to call the external service when it receives a "callService" message and respond with either the service's response or an error message if the circuit is open.
